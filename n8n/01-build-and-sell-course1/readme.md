## Introduction (~0:00 - 0:15:00)
- **Overview**: The course teaches how to build and monetize AI agents using n8n, a no-code automation platform, without requiring programming skills.
- **Target Audience**: Beginners, entrepreneurs, and small business owners looking to automate tasks or create sellable AI solutions.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **n8n**: An open-source, no-code workflow automation tool that connects apps and services via "nodes" to create automated processes called "workflows."
  - **AI Agents**: Automated systems that perform tasks (e.g., data processing, customer support) using AI integrations like language models or APIs.
  - **No-Code**: Building complex systems using visual interfaces without writing code.
- **Course Goals**:
  - Learn to set up n8n and create AI-driven workflows.
  - Understand how to integrate AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Google APIs).
  - Develop strategies to sell AI agents to clients or on marketplaces.
- **Prerequisites**: Basic computer literacy; no prior coding or n8n experience required.
- **Resources Mentioned**:
  - n8n Community: https://community.n8n.io/
  - n8n Documentation: https://docs.n8n.io/
  - Free n8n account: https://n8n.io/

## Setting Up n8n (~0:15:00 - 1:00:00)
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Node**: A single action or step in an n8n workflow (e.g., send email, fetch data).
  - **Workflow**: A sequence of connected nodes that automate a process.
  - **Cloud vs. Self-Hosted**: n8n can be used via n8n.cloud (managed hosting) or self-hosted on platforms like Docker or AWS.
- **Step-by-Step Setup**:
  1. **Create an n8n Account**:
     - Visit https://n8n.io/ and sign up for a free cloud account or download the self-hosted version.
     - For cloud: Use email to register; verify via email link.
     - For self-hosted: Install Docker, then run `docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 n8n`.
  2. **Access n8n Dashboard**:
     - Cloud: Log in to n8n.cloud.
     - Self-hosted: Open `http://localhost:5678` in a browser.
  3. **Configure User Settings**:
     - Set up a user profile with a secure password.
     - Enable two-factor authentication for security (optional but recommended).
  4. **Explore Interface**:
     - **Canvas**: Visual workspace to build workflows.
     - **Node Library**: Drag-and-drop nodes for apps (e.g., Gmail, Slack) or custom HTTP requests.
     - **Executions**: View logs of workflow runs.
- **Tips**:
  - Start with n8n.cloud for simplicity; self-hosting requires technical setup but offers more control.
  - Save workflows frequently to avoid losing progress.
  - Use the n8n community forum for troubleshooting setup issues.
- **Resources**:
  - Docker installation guide: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

## Building AI Agents (~1:00:00 - 4:30:00)
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **AI Integration**: Using APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face) to add AI capabilities like text generation or sentiment analysis to workflows.
  - **Triggers**: Events that start a workflow (e.g., form submission, schedule).
  - **Data Transformation**: Modifying data (e.g., filtering, formatting) within workflows.
- **Step-by-Step: Building a Basic AI Agent**:
  1. **Create a New Workflow**:
     - In n8n dashboard, click "New Workflow."
     - Name it (e.g., "Customer Support AI").
  2. **Add a Trigger Node**:
     - Choose a trigger (e.g., "Webhook" for form submissions or "Schedule" for timed tasks).
     - Example: Webhook node to receive data from a Google Form.
     - Configure Webhook URL and test with a sample form submission.
  3. **Integrate AI API**:
     - Add an "HTTP Request" node to connect to an AI API (e.g., OpenAI’s ChatGPT).
     - Obtain API key from OpenAI (https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
     - Set HTTP method to POST, URL to `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`.
     - Add headers: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`.
     - Configure body with JSON payload (e.g., `{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this text: {{ $json.input }}"}]}).
  4. **Process AI Output**:
     - Add a "Set" node to extract AI response (e.g., `{{ $json.choices[0].message.content }}`).
     - Use a "Switch" node to route data based on conditions (e.g., positive/negative sentiment).
  5. **Output Results**:
     - Add an output node (e.g., "Send Email" via Gmail or "Post to Slack").
     - Configure credentials for the output app (e.g., Gmail OAuth).
  6. **Test Workflow**:
     - Activate workflow and send test data via the trigger.
     - Check "Executions" tab for errors or logs.
- **Examples and Use Cases**:
  - **Customer Support Agent**: Responds to customer inquiries using ChatGPT, routes urgent queries to a human via Slack.
  - **Content Generator**: Creates blog post ideas from keywords, emails results to a marketing team.
  - **Data Enrichment**: Fetches company details from a CRM and enhances with AI-generated insights.
- **Tips**:
  - Test nodes individually before connecting to avoid debugging complex workflows.
  - Use n8n’s "Test Workflow" feature to simulate data flow.
  - Store API keys securely in n8n’s credentials manager.

## Advanced AI Agent Features (~4:30:00 - 6:30:00)
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **LLM Chains**: Sequential AI tasks (e.g., summarize text, then translate).
  - **Structured Outputs**: Formatting AI responses (e.g., JSON for downstream processing).
  - **Error Handling**: Adding fallback nodes to manage API failures.
- **Step-by-Step: Enhancing AI Agents**:
  1. **Create LLM Chains**:
     - Chain multiple HTTP Request nodes (e.g., one for summarization, another for translation).
     - Pass data between nodes using n8n expressions (e.g., `{{ $node["Summarize"].json.output }}`).
  2. **Structure Outputs**:
     - Use "Set" node to format AI output into JSON (e.g., `{"result": "{{ $json.output }}", "timestamp": "{{ $now }}"}`).
     - Validate JSON with a "Code" node if needed (JavaScript not required but supported for simple parsing).
  3. **Add Error Handling**:
     - Add an "If" node to check for API errors (e.g., `{{ $node["HTTP Request"].json.error }}`).
     - Route errors to a fallback node (e.g., send notification via email).
  4. **Scale Workflows**:
     - Use "Loop Over Items" node for batch processing (e.g., process multiple form submissions).
     - Optimize performance by limiting API calls (e.g., batch requests).
- **Examples**:
  - **Social Media Monitor**: Analyzes tweets for sentiment, summarizes trends, and posts results to a dashboard.
  - **Lead Scoring Agent**: Scores leads from a CRM using AI, tags high-priority leads for follow-up.
- **Tips**:
  - Monitor API rate limits (e.g., OpenAI’s 200 requests/minute for free tier).
  - Use n8n’s "Merge" node to combine data from multiple sources.
  - Save complex workflows as templates for reuse.

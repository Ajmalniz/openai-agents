# DACA Agent-Native Cloud Local Development

This project implements a sophisticated multi-AI agent system using the Dapr Agentic Cloud Ascent (DACA) architecture and Agent-Native Cloud Technologies. The system leverages Kubernetes for orchestration and Dapr for distributed capabilities, with AI agents as stateful Dapr Actors, FastAPI APIs for user interaction, and Pub/Sub for scalable agent communication.

## üöÄ Project Structure

The project is organized into core modules that guide you through building a complete DACA agent system:

- **01_intro_fastapi/**: Implementation of agent endpoints using FastAPI, including basic setup, validation, parameters, and a `/chat` API for DACA agents
- **02_cloud_native_setup/**: Kubernetes configuration for DACA agents, including container setup and Helm charts
- **03_dapr_intro/**: Dapr integration with Pub/Sub and state store configurations
- **04_security_fundamentals**: Core security implementations for DACA agents
- **05_agent_actors**: Dapr Virtual Actors implementation for DACA agents
- **06_daca_workflows**: Complex AI-driven workflow orchestration
- **07_security_advanced**: Production-grade security implementations

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Follow the modules sequentially or jump to specific sections based on your expertise
3. Each module includes hands-on exercises to build and test DACA agents

## üìä Architecture

The system architecture consists of:

- Kubernetes cluster for orchestration
- Dapr for distributed capabilities
- FastAPI for API endpoints
- Pub/Sub for agent communication
- Stateful Dapr Actors for AI agents

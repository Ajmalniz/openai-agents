# Explanation of `agent.py`

This document explains the code found in `.venv/Lib/site-packages/agents/agent.py`, which is a core part of an agentic AI SDK. The file defines the main `Agent` class and related types for configuring, running, and managing AI agents.

## Overview

The `agent.py` file provides the implementation for the `Agent` class, which represents an AI agent capable of handling instructions, tools, guardrails, handoffs, and more. The agent is highly configurable and supports advanced features such as tool orchestration, model selection, and output validation.

## Key Components

### 1. `Agent` Class
- **Purpose:** Represents an AI agent with configurable instructions, tools, models, guardrails, and handoffs.
- **Type Parameter:** `TContext` â€” allows the agent to operate with a user-defined context object.
- **Main Fields:**
  - `name`: The agent's name.
  - `instructions`: System prompt or a function to generate it dynamically.
  - `handoff_description`: Description for use in handoff scenarios.
  - `handoffs`: List of sub-agents or handoff objects for delegation.
  - `model`: The LLM model or model name to use.
  - `model_settings`: Model-specific parameters (e.g., temperature, top_p).
  - `tools`: List of tools the agent can use.
  - `mcp_servers`: List of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for tool discovery.
  - `mcp_config`: Configuration for MCP servers.
  - `input_guardrails`/`output_guardrails`: Lists of guardrails for input/output validation.
  - `output_type`: Specifies the expected output type (e.g., dataclass, Pydantic model).
  - `hooks`: Optional lifecycle hooks for agent events.
  - `tool_use_behavior`: Controls how tool calls are handled (e.g., run LLM again, stop on first tool, custom function).
  - `reset_tool_choice`: Whether to reset tool choice after a tool call.

### 2. Tool and Output Handling
- **`ToolsToFinalOutputResult`**: Indicates if tool results are final output or if the LLM should run again.
- **`ToolsToFinalOutputFunction`**: Type alias for a function that decides how tool results are handled.
- **`StopAtTools`**: TypedDict for specifying tool names that should stop further agent execution.

### 3. MCP Integration
- **`MCPConfig`**: Configuration for MCP servers, such as schema strictness.
- **`get_mcp_tools`**: Async method to fetch tools from MCP servers.
- **`get_all_tools`**: Async method to get all tools (MCP + function tools).

### 4. Guardrails
- **Input Guardrails:** Run before agent generates a response (for validation/filtering).
- **Output Guardrails:** Run after agent generates a response (for validation/filtering).

### 5. Tool Conversion and Cloning
- **`as_tool`**: Converts the agent into a callable tool for use by other agents.
- **`clone`**: Returns a copy of the agent with optional modifications.

### 6. System Prompt Handling
- **`get_system_prompt`**: Returns the system prompt, supporting both static strings and dynamic functions.

## Example Usage
```python
agent = Agent(
    name="MyAgent",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
    tools=[...],
    model="gpt-4o",
    ...
)
```

## Summary
- The `Agent` class is the central abstraction for building agentic AI systems in this SDK.
- It supports modularity (handoffs, tools), extensibility (guardrails, hooks), and advanced orchestration (tool use behavior, MCP integration).
- The design allows for both simple and highly customized agent behaviors.
